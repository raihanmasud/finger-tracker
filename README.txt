Visual Finger Tracking Project 

Analysis of Tactile Map Reading (ATMR) is a project which helps the scientists 
to analyses the blind people's behaviors of using haptics map. As a sub-project, 
Visual Finger Tracking extracts the position information of each finger tips from 
the experimental videos of blind people using haptics map. These important data 
can be used in the data analysis part of ATMR.
